# # Tuple

# Lists arenâ€™t the only data types that represent ordered sequences of values. For example, tuples and lists are actually similar.Many of the things you can do with lists can also be done with tuple: indexing; slicing; and using them with for loops, with len().

# In[ ]:


candies = ('hello', 42, 0.5)  # creating tuple


# In[ ]:


candies[0]  # indexing


# In[ ]:


candies[1:3] # slicing


# In[ ]:


t=()  # empty tuple


# In[ ]:


t1=(100,)
t1


# 
# In Python, (11,) is a tuple with a single element 11.
# 
# The comma after 11 is important because it differentiates a tuple with a single element from a simple integer with parentheses.
# 
# To create a tuple in Python, you simply enclose the elements in parentheses and separate them with commas.

# ### Comparing tuples

# In Python, you can compare tuples using the comparison operators such as **<, <=, >, >=, ==**, and **!=**.
# 
# Tuples are compared element-wise, starting from the leftmost element, and the comparison stops as soon as a mismatch is found.

# In[ ]:


t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (1, 2, 4)
print(t1 < t2 )  
print(t1 > t2)
print(t1 == t2)
print(t1 != t2)

# 
# 
# ### Tuple Assignments
# 
# Tuple assignment is a feature in Python that allows you to assign multiple variables at once by unpacking the values in a tuple. Here's an example:
# 
# 

# In[ ]:


my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = my_tuple
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)


# In[ ]:


a,b = 10,20
print(a)
print(b)
print(a,b)


# In[ ]:


# Swapping two variables
a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a

print(a) # Output: 2
print(b) # Output: 1


# 
# 
# ### Updating Tuple
# 
# 

# Tuples are immutable. So we an extract, assign or update values of one tuple by creating another tuple.

# In[ ]:


t1=(10,20,30)
t2=(40,50)
t3=t1+t2
print(t3)


# 
# 
# ### Deleting Tuple
# 
# 

# we can delete tuple using **del** statement.

# In[ ]:


T1=(10,20,30,40)


# In[ ]:


del T1


# In[ ]:


print(T1)


# 
# 
# ### zip() fuction
# 
# 

# In Python, the **zip()** function can be used to combine two or more iterables into a single iterable of tuples. Each tuple contains the corresponding elements from the input iterables.
# 
# Here's an example:

# In[ ]:


t=(10,20,30)
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(list(zip(t,my_tuple)))

# 
# ## Dictionary
# 
#

# ### Operations and Methods

# **In code, a dictionary is typed with braces, { }.**

del d["banana"]

print(d)


# #### 2 . pop() method

# In[ ]:


my_dict2 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}

# 
# 

# In[ ]:


my_dict = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}
my_dict["banana"] = 4

print(my_dict)


# ### Methods in dictionary
# 
# 
# ![](../images/unit_5_05.png)

# In[ ]:


# create a dictionary
my_dict_1 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}

# items() method : (dictionary & tuple)
my_dict_4 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}
items = my_dict_4.items()
print(items)


# keys() method
my_dict_5 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}
keys = my_dict_5.keys()
print(keys)


# values() method
my_dict_6 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}

print(values)


# pop() method
my_dict_7 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}
value = my_dict_7.pop("banana")
print(value)
print(my_dict_7)


# popitem() method

item = my_dict_8.popitem()
print(item)
print(my_dict_8)


# setdefault() method
my_dict_9 = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}
value = my_dict_9.setdefault("pear", 4)
print(value)

# #### Multiple Assignment with Dictionaries
# 
# 

# In[ ]:


person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'location': 'New York'}
for key , value in list(person.items()):
  print(key , value)


# Above code iterates over the key-value pairs in the person dictionary using a for loop and the items() method.
# 

# In[ ]:


# Define a dictionary
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'location': 'New York'}

# Assign multiple values to multiple variables
name, age, location = person['name'], person['age'], person['location']

# Print the values of the variables
print(name)        # Output: John
print(age)         # Output: 25
print(location)    # Output: New York


# Multiple assignment with dictionaries allows you to assign multiple values to multiple variables at once using a dictionary. This can be useful when you have a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs and you want to assign each value to a separate variable.

# Q. Create a code that will try to mimic the SUPEROVER scenario from Cricket. You have to create 2 dictionaries for 2 teams and each dictionary will contain the outcome of 6 balls bowled in the superover as key (i.e- run scored on that ball) and values of that dictionary will be as follows:
# 
# 
# *   'W' : 0 runs
# *   'R' : 1-6 runs
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# The runs scored will be generated randomly using `random` module by using `random.randint(0,6)` and make sure that you are including the number 5 in dictionary deliberately even though there is no 5 runs in cricket. You also have to track the number of wickets fallen in that superover.
# 
# Also make sure that your dictionary has 6 unique keys for every deliveries in a superover. The output of the code should be dictionaries of both the teams and scorecard along with the number of wickets fallen, by comparing the scores of both the teams show which team has won in superover, as shown in the example below:
# 
# **Example :**
# 
# Performance of Team1 : {0: 'W', 1: 'R', 3: 'R', 4: 'R', 5: 'R', 6: 'R'}
# 
# Performance of Team2 : {0: 'W', 1: 'R', 3: 'R', 4: 'R', 5: 'R', 6: 'R'}
# 
# Scorecard of Team1 : 19 / 1
# 
# Scorecard of Team2 : 19 / 1
# >>>Its a Draw!
# 
# 
# Performance of Team1 : {0: 'W', 1: 'R', 2: 'R', 4: 'R', 5: 'R', 6: 'R'}
# 
# Performance of Team2 : {0: 'W', 1: 'R', 2: 'R', 3: 'R', 4: 'R', 6: 'R'}
# 
# Scorecard of Team1 : 18 / 1
# 
# Scorecard of Team2 : 16 / 1
# >>>Team1 wins by 2 runs!
# 
# Performance of Team1 : {0: 'W', 1: 'R', 3: 'R', 4: 'R', 5: 'R', 6: 'R'}
# 
# Performance of Team2 : {0: 'W', 1: 'R', 2: 'R', 3: 'R', 4: 'R', 5: 'R'}
# 
# Scorecard of Team1 : 19 / 1
# 
# Scorecard of Team2 : 15 / 1
# 
# >>>Team1 wins by 4 runs!
