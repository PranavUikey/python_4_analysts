    "The terms - \"monolithic\", \"structural\", \"procedural\", and \"OOP\" - refer to different paradigms or approaches in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1 . Monolithic:** Monolithic architecture is a traditional software development approach in which all the code is built as a single unit or module. This means that all the components of an application are tightly coupled together, making it difficult to modify and scale the application. Monolithic architecture is often used for small to medium-sized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 . Structural:** Structural programming is a programming paradigm in which the focus is on breaking down a program into smaller, manageable parts. This is achieved by dividing the program into functions or procedures, each of which performs a specific task. The functions or procedures are then called in a specific order to accomplish the overall task. Structural programming is typically used for large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3 . Procedural:** Procedural programming is a subset of structural programming in which the focus is on defining procedures that perform specific tasks. These procedures can be called from other parts of the program to accomplish the overall task. Procedural programming is often used for scientific and mathematical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects rather than functions or procedures. An object is an instance of a class, which is a template that defines the properties and behaviors of the object. OOP is designed to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications by providing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP is widely used for developing modern software applications, including web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, these terms represent different approaches to software development, with each having its strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the right approach depends on the specific requirements of the project.\n",
